After scrolling through open processing trying to find a code that I like, I came across 200413 by Sayama. https://openprocessing.org/sketch/872580
I enjoyed the fluid motion the ghost has and the shading using a bunch of dots.
I would like to learn how to place thee tiny dots to make it look like pointillism shading.
